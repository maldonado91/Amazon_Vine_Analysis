# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### 1. Overview of Project:
#### We selected a pet product dataset to perform ETL and determine if there is bias associated with Vine member and non Vine members

### 2. Results: 

   
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

### 3. Summary:
#### There is a slight bias between vine members and non vine members. Members show a 1% point higher in 5 star reviews than non members. The next recommendation would be to look at all star reviews and search for a trend. If there are very low 1 and/or 2 star reviews for members then we might have a clear bias between the two groups.
