# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

### 1. Overview of Project:
#### We selected a pet product dataset to perform ETL and determine if there is bias associated with Vine member and non Vine members

### 2. Results: 

   
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

### 3. Summary:
#### There is a clear distinction between between male and females when it comes to bikes and we also noticed some interesting trends on bike usage in relation to the hour of the day. Bikes have a played a huge role for those getting to and from work in the weekdays. 

#### Two areas I'd like to revist are 
  1) Age of riders
  2) Start/ending stations
